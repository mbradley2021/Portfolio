This is the final code that was used in my senior design project to have it track the sun. On page 78 of the pdf called "Final Report Solar" starts the 
tracking portion of our report which is the part of the project I was Team leader of. It has a overveiw of what we did and all the design work that we 
added to get it work . As well as the final picture of the box that housed all the electronics. 

I also provided a video that shows the pv system tracking the sun.
