This contains the code that I used in my Embedded systems class in 2018. The goal was to make a semi autonomous car. If you go to 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u0ezQo0BgI this is someone that took the class and video taped it last semeter . It will give you a good
idea of what we were trying to accomplish . I could not video mine as I used my phone as a controller to send commmands.

Also our report is uploaded in as a pdf. This is the only copy I have and it is what we submitted for our project 9 , the goal was to 
keep adding sections as we turned in each project. Because of that section 5 and the conclusion is missing in the report.
