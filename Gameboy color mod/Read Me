I use to buy broken gameboy colors and take them apart to figure out why they didn't work. I would then fix them and modifiy them to have a front light on them . 
Then to get the front light to stick to the lcd screen I used a addhesive called LOCA which is clear that would also enhance the light on the screen.
Also to make my gameboys look different online when I sold them I added a touch sensor behind the Nintendo logo so you could turn off
the light when you used it outside or in a lit room to save on battery power. 
The video I have in the folder shows the front light turning on and off with the touch sensor behind the logo.
